## Materials

Materials will be made available on [github](https://github.com/cwickham/genentech-build-tidy-tools). 
The materials will evolve as the workshop approaches, so if you want to pre-download the materials, please wait until the day before the workshop.  

However, please don't delay on [Setup][setup].  You'll want to uncover any problems in getting the required packages before our first session together.

## Setup

<!-- Fix later to generate from content of repo like https://github.com/hadley/tidy-tools/blob/master/README.Rmd -->

The most important package for Day 1 is devtools:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```
If you've installed devtools before, 
you should check the component packages are also up to date,
by following any instructions under the `devtools` section in the output of:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::dev_sitrep()
```

  
To be prepared beyond Day 1, you'll also need the following packages:
```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
deps <- unique(sort(renv::dependencies()$Package))
deps <- setdiff(deps, c(
  "ns", # created during class
  "rmarkdown", "knitr", # only needed for .Rmd
  "countdown", # only needed for instructor
  "renv", # only needed for this block,
  "gt", # only need for this README
  "bizarro", # making it 
  c("stats", "MASS", "datasets"), # recommended
  c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat"),
  tidyverse::tidyverse_packages(),
  NULL
))
install <- c(
  paste0("install.packages(c(", paste0(encodeString(deps, quote = '"'), collapse = ", "), "))")
)
```
```{r code = install, eval = FALSE}
```

```r
# You may also need:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "stringr"))

# And get some partial packages we'll work with later:
usethis::create_from_github("skaltman/fordogs", fork = FALSE)
usethis::create_from_github("cwickham/ns", fork = FALSE)
usethis::create_from_github("cwickham/tidytest", fork = FALSE)
```

<!-- 
* When you're done, put a green post-it on your computer. 
* If you need help, put up a pink post-it.
-->
If you're all set, you might like to download the first set of slides.

## Schedule

```{r echo = FALSE}

) %>% 
  mutate(
    date = (as.Date("2020-09-14") + (day - 1)) %>% day_fmt(),
    desc = glue::glue("**{topic}**\n 
    *{instructor}*\n
    {notes}\n
    <small>{desc}</small>")
  )
schedule %>% 
  select(date, desc, session) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = session, values_from = desc) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::cols_label(`1` = "8:30am-10:00am", `2` = "10:30am-12:00pm",
    date = "Day") %>% 
  gt::fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE, rows = TRUE) %>%  
  gt::as_raw_html()
```

The notes will be live coded and committed as we go, 
so they may be empty if you are looking at them before the workshop.

You can see the scripts we'll work from in [`script/`](script/), but we recommend not reading too far ahead because you'll find answers to some of the exercises, and you'll learn more if you try to work through them first.

## Getting Help

## Overview

This is a hands on workshop for those who have embraced the tidyverse and now want to expand it to meet their own needs. We'll discuss API design, functional programming tools, the basics of object design in S3, and the tidy eval system for NSE.

At the end of the workshop participants will be able to:

* Apply an efficient workflow for building R packages, 
documenting functions and unit testing using the usethis and devtools packages.

* Implement commonly used frameworks inside packages like tidy evaluation and object oriented programming.

* Critique the interface of a package and suggest improvements
that would make the package easier to learn and use.

You should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to tackle larger scale problems. You'll get the most from it if you're already familiar with functions and are comfortable with Râ€™s basic data structures (vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data frames). 

## Is this course for me?

Have you written a few of your own R functions? Are you ready to start sharing your code (or data) through R packages? Are you curious what you can do to make your first R packages easy for your users to use, and for you to maintain?
