**Your Turn**: Breakout Rooms

The following calls use variables: 
`mtcars`, `cyl`, `mpg`, `starwars`, `homeworld`, and `species`.
But, you could group them into two types of variables. 

Discuss:  What are the two groups? How would you describe the groups?
```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), mpg = mean(mpg))
starwars %>% 
  filter(homeworld == "Naboo", species == "Human")
```
